# write your name with alphabetical order

## Here are the alphabetical order rules for words or names:

1. Compare letters one by one: Start by comparing the first letter of each word or name.
2. Alphabetical order: The word with the letter that comes earlier in the alphabet comes first. For example, "Apple" comes before "Banana" because "A" comes before "B".
2. Same first letter: If the first letters are the same, move on to the second letter. Continue comparing letters until you find a difference. The word with the letter that comes earlier alphabetically comes first.
4. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization: These don't affect alphabetical order. For example, "Amen" would come before "arif" even though "arif" is lowercase.
